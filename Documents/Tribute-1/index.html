                        <p>~Chadwick was born in Anderson, South Carolina. He studied directing at Howard University.</p>
                        <p>~During this time at Howard, he was a student of Phylicia Rashad, who came together with
                        Denzel Washington to fundraise money so that Boseman and a few other students could attend
                        the Oxford Mid-Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy in London.</p>
                        <p>~It wasn't until 2008 that he moved to LA to pursue his career in acting.</p>
                        <p>~His breakthrough performance was playing famous baseball player Jackie Robinsdon in 42.</p>
                        <p>~He continued to play historical roles, such as: James Brown in <em>Get On Up</em> and
                            Thurgood Marshall in <em>Marshall</em>.</p>
                        <p>~<em>Black Panther</em> gave Boseman international fame from 2016 to 2019</p>
                        <p>~It came as a surprise to many when news came out regarding his death because he kept his
                            diagnoses with stage IV colon cancer a secret while playing iconic roles. </p>
