Install\n\n```shell\n$ npm install if-env --save\n```\n\n### 2. Add to `package.json`\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"if-env SOME_ENV_VAR=some_val ANOTHER_ENV_VAR=another_val && npm run this || npm run that\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## License\n\n> MIT &copy; Eric Clemmons 2015\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ericclemmons","email":"eric@smarterspam.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-28T00:08:52.600Z","created":"2015-12-23T05:23:59.127Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-23T05:23:59.127Z","1.0.1":"2018-01-28T00:06:47.665Z","1.0.2":"2018-01-28T00:07:17.186Z","1.0.3":"2018-01-28T00:08:09.851Z","1.0.4":"2018-01-28T00:08:52.600Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ericclemmons/if-env#readme","keywords":["npm","script","env","if","run"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ericclemmons/if-env.git"},"author":{"name":"Eric Clemmons","email":"eric@smarterspam.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ericclemmons/if-env/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"mysticatea":true,"igsys":true,"protovore":true,"princetoad":true,"serge-nikitin":true,"dalcib":true,"jtrh":true,"tommyldunn":true,"nickgogan":true},"_attachments":{}}
